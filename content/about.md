Hello! My name is Meera Kota, and I am currently a Masterâ€™s student at UC Berkeley studying GeoSystems Engineering, within the Civil Engineering department. My research interests include natural hazard mitigation and resilient infrastructure design, within the context of climate change. In my free time I like to read and explore the Bay Area! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
